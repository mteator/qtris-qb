Thank you for buying Qtris!

Qtris has been in development for a month now, and it really shows!  Over
2 megs of 256 color graphics are included with Qtris, and every one of them 
is breathtaking.  Here is a quick start to Qtris:

Keys to play:
    Left, Right arrow keys: Move piece.
    Up arrow key:           Rotate piece.
    Down arrow key:         Drop piece.
    S key:                  Switch piece with next piece
    P key:                  Pause key.  Note: do not use
                            the Pause key on the keyboard,
                            the program will abort with an
                            error.
    ESC or Q:               Quit to the menu.

If you pause the game for more than 10 seconds, you will see a great
screen saver.

Note: Make sure you execute Qtris in the same directory as the files are
located in.  The program will abort if it cannot find the files.
